Lyx Notebook is a program which allows the word processor Lyx to be used as a
code-evaluating notebook (similar to Mathematica notebooks or the Sage
notebook).  

It only works with interactive, interpreted languages.  The currently-supported
languages are Python 2, Python 3, Sage, Scala, and R.  There are custom insets
for code cells and output cells.  When a cell is evaluated the output is sent
to the output cell.  The program keeps interpreter processes running,
maintaining their state.  The Listings package is used to highlight the code in
the code cells in the Latex-formatted printable output.

See the file lyxNotebookDocs.pdf for a detailed description.  There are example
Lyx files in the examples directory.

This program only works on Linux systems, and has only been tested on Fedora 15
with Lyx 2.0.3.  Most of the testing has been with Python 2 code cells.  There
may well be portability problems to other Linux distributions, but probably not
serious ones.  The program is licensed under the same GPL as Lyx.
